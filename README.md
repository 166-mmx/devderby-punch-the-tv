# Punch the TV

My attempt to Mozilla DevDerby for topic: July 2011 HTML5 <video>

Original description:
*Image on TV screen can be a bit noisy or distorted - use a fist to repair it.. or not*

The application has implemented few special effects which display video like on old Elektron screen. 
A click on the fist causes changing/adding/removing effect of distortion and a noise.
Special panel (which fade in, when a cursor moves onto right part of TV) provides controls to manipulate contrast, brightness, volume and noise (tune).

All fade-in animations use CSS3 animations as well as animation of a fist.
